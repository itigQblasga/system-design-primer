## Is Facebook Message Recovery Tool V12 Legit?
 
The short answer is no. Facebook Message Recovery Tool V12 is not a legitimate software, but a scam that tries to trick you into installing malware or paying money for a fake service. There are several red flags that indicate that this tool is not trustworthy:
 
- It has no official website or developer information. The only way to find it is through dubious links on SoundCloud[^3^] [^4^] or PDF files[^2^].
- It asks for your email address and password to access your Facebook account. This is a phishing attempt that can compromise your account and personal information.
- It requires you to pay a fee or complete a survey to unlock the recovery feature. This is a common tactic used by scammers to make money from unsuspecting users.
- It does not work as advertised. Even if you pay or complete the survey, the tool will not recover any messages for you. Instead, it may install malware or adware on your computer that can harm your system or display unwanted ads.

- Download your Facebook data. If you have deleted a message permanently, you may still be able to find it in your Facebook data. To download your data, go to "Settings", click on "Your Facebook Information" and then "Download Your Information". You can then select the data you want to download, such as messages, and click on "Create File". You will receive an email when your file is ready to download. You can then open the file and look for the message you want to recover.
- Contact the other person. If none of the above methods work, you can try contacting the person you had the conversation with and ask them if they still have a copy of the message. They may be able to send it back to you or take a screenshot of it.

## Conclusion
 
Facebook Message Recovery Tool V12 is a scam that you should avoid at all costs. It does not help you recover deleted messages, but instead tries to steal your information or money. If you want to restore deleted messages from Facebook, you should use the official methods provided by Facebook or contact the other person involved in the conversation.
